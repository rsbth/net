\section{Review Methodology}

\\Pilot study:
\\
Firstly, we wanted to work to improve security in networks and chose a specific topic "Contract signing". On searching in the IEEE Explore with "Contract Signing", we found that its a huge topic (336 results) and required a lot more time.So we reformulated the question by adding two new keywords "Abuse-free" and "optimistic" to narrow down the search and also get more relevant papers. With a basic search on the IEEE Explore we found 4 papers and using this research question, we want to move forward on the SLR in addressing gaps with contract signing over the network for more than 2 parties.

Search Strings: 
\\
 Security in networks is the domain chosen initially for exploring the subject and “Contract Signing” is chosen as the topic of interest .As, topic is huge and takes a lot more time, the search is narrowed down by adding keywords “Abuse-free” AND “Optimistic” as we are more interested in the field. A basic search along with the new keywords is performed, papers found are analysed and synthesised.
