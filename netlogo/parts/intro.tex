\section{Introduction}

Dining philosophers problem is a synchronisation problem, popular in the computer science domain. The problem starts with philosophers meeting for spagetti on a round table, who can be only in one of the three states, namely thinking, hungry and eating. Each philosopher in the problem is provided with a fork next to him and inorder to eat the spagetti, the philosopher will require two forks.Therefore, it is obvious from the problem that all philosophers cannot access (eat) the spagetti at the same time. The forks in the problem can be visualized as a shared resource. Generally, there are two issues with the setting namely starvation and deadlock. Starvation can be viewed as one of the philosophers being in the hungry state for a relatively large intreval with the neighbour not releasing the fork. Deadlock is a situation when philosophers hold a fork and doesnt release it until they get the other, this state is called circular wait and leads to a deadlock. Although resources are available, it is possible that neighter of the philosophers get a chance to access the spagetti due to deadlock. This in computer science can be viewed in terms of shared resources and processes trying to access the shared resource at the same time. Deadlocks are not desirable due to the fact that idle time for the shared resource will be high, resulting in  a high response time-
